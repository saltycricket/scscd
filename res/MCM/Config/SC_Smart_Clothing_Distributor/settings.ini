; Integer percentage value betwen [0, 100].
;
; What is the likelihood of replacing the current outfit?
; A value of 100 would always replace the default outfit.
; A value of 0 effectively disables this mod.
;
; Note that even with a value of 100 if a viable outfit can't be produced
; based on other rules or not enough clothings, NPCs can still end up with an
; unaltered outfit.
;
; By default males are given a lower percentage, simply because there seem to
; be much fewer male outfit mods available. This should keep the diversity
; high for males on a typical installations.

; Amount by which to bias searches towards matching armor pieces.
; If zero, items will be chosen completely at random. Other
; values:
;
; 0.0-0.5       : Very gentle bias. Almost uniform, small nudge toward better
;                 matches.
; 1.0           : Moderate bias. Similar candidates are 2-3x more likely, but
;                 random variation is still significant.
; 2.0 (default) : Stronger clustering. "Set" pieces will dominate, but not to
;                 the exclusion of variety.
; 3.0-5.0       : Very strong bias. The algorithm behaves almost like "pick
;                 the best match every time" with a little noise left.
; >5.0          : Practically deterministic. Unless two items tie in
;                 similarity, the same partner will be picked every time.
;
fProximityBias=2.0

; Slots 36 and 55 are usually used as underwear slots. Some mods provide
; "clothing" in these slots that intentionally expose the character (that is
; -- mods that are Actually NSFW). Thus, allowing those items to be equipped
; could produce rather "immodest" characters.
;
; If you'd like to use Actually NSFW clothing mods, then set this to 1.
; Otherwise leave it at 0 which will not include those kinds of items
; in the generated outfits.
;
; Default = 0 (never use Actually NSFW clothing).
;
bAllowNSFW=0

; If 1, it is possible to retrieve a wardrobe with slots 36 (on women) and
; 39 (on men and women) not filled. Recommendation: leave 1 if you have no
; underwear items, otherwise nothing will ever be chosen. If you do have items
; to fill those slots, it's down to preference. Allowing "nudity" MAY reduce
; clipping artifacts since those slots won't be filled.
; 
; Note that 'nudity' here means 'slots 36 and 39 might not be filled'. It does
; NOT necessarily mean 'the bits are showing' - that will depend on what is
; chosen for all other slots combined.
;
; Default = 0
;
bAllowNudity=0

; Whether Outfitter should force-replace any armor that the NPC was spawned
; with. Might affect game balance by replacing leveled armor with clothing!
; If true, the original armor will remain in the NPC's inventory but might not
; actually be used by the NPC. If false, the NPC will use their leveled armor
; and no clothing will ever replace it.
bReplaceArmor=1


; Integer percentage value between [0, 100] representing the % chance that the
; slot WILL be filled by this mod.
;
; Any slots not specified here default to zero (no chance).
;
; (Note: another item on a different slot that happens to fill more than one
; slot may still be chosen and fill an ignored slot, so even with a chance
; set to zero, you can still see it get filled depending on your other slot
; chances.)
; 
; Not all mods follow the same convention with regard to slot meaning. SCSCD
; attempts to normalize slot meanings across all of its bundled CSVs,
; but any 3rd party CSVs not bundled with the SCSCD core mod may not have done
; this, and in that case SCSCD will fall back to the author's original slots.
; If that happens, you can end up with mods that don't use the slots as
; described, and you can reduce the likelihood of clothings from those mods
; by accident. For example, if a mod creates a shirt and assigns it to the
; "Hat" category, and the CSV author doesn't fix this mapping, then changing
; the "Scalp" chances would affect that particular shirt.
